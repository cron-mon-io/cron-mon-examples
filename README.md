# Cron Mon Examples

This repository contains examples for setting up Cron Mon in various ways.

## Required infrastructure

Cron Mon requires a PostgreSQL database and a running Keycloak server in order for it to function. All of these examples include this supporting infrastructure to give you an idea of how you might set this up yourself with the corresponding technology/ platform, but you are free to set this up however you so wish. So long as Cron Mon can access them, it does not matter where or how they are setup.

## Compose

For an example of how Cron Mon can be set up using Compose, see [the `cron-mon/compose/` directory](cron-mon/compose/README.md).
